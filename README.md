# Tableau Story About the Covid-19 Pandemic
This Tableau story showcases my skills in Tableau. It features visualizations depicting dynamics associated with the Covid-19 pandemic in Europe. It helps healthcare professionals and decision makers make informed decisions.

Please open the story in Tableau Reader. Tableau Reader is a free software application that allows users to view and interact with Tableau visualizations and dashboards, but it doesn't enable the creation or editing of these visualizations. 

You can download Tableau Reader here: https://www.tableau.com/en-gb/products/reader
Then, download the following workbook file and open it in Tableau Reader: https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuBDsNy-jbNtgeINT0LOIsnSYZfMyg?e=xwcgON
